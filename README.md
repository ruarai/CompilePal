Compile Pal X is the official rewrite of Compile Pal - the amazing wrapper for the source map compiling tools that makes compiling a breeze.

Configuration
==========

Compile Pal should automatically find any game configurations - as long as the game's SDK was run last. Game Configurations are cached between sessions, and you can choose between them at launch.

==========
PACK is a feature that allows for the automatic packing of custom content into a map BSP. Thanks to the work of Maxdup, this feature is now ready to be used in production.

### Packable Content
- Materials

- Model Skins
- Skybox Textures
- Sprites
- Water Materials
- Color Correction
- Detail Files
- Menu Photos
- Soundscapes
- Soundscripts
- Particle Manifests
- Much more...
